## Hash Map in C++
### unordered_map (elements are not in order)
Time Complexity for finding an element in a hash is 
O(1) => Best and average case.
O(N) => Worst case (when collision occurs, which is very rare case)

### map (elements are arranged in order)
Time Complexity for finding an element in a hash is 
O(log N) => Best,average and worst case.
