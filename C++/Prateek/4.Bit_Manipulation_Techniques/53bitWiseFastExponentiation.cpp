/* Fast Exponentiation :     Lets say a =3 and power is 5 => 3^5 is the input and convert it as 3^(101), where 101 is the binary representation of 5
                        Where we need to start a "count" variable with an initial value as 1
                        during 1st iteration, if first bit value valid, multiply "count" variable with 3, else do nothing. Then multiply a =a*a, shift n one time 
                        during 2nd iteration, if second bit value valid, multiply "count" variable with 3, else do nothing. Then multiply a =a*a, shift n one time 
                        during 3rd iteration, if third bit value valid, multiply "count" variable with 3, else do nothing. Then multiply a =a*a, shift n one time 

                        Complexity is O(logn)
